            <h2>About</h2>
            Infiltration attacks refer to the unauthorized entry of malicious entities into a secure
            environment, often with the goal of gaining access to sensitive information or compromising
            the integrity of a system.Techniques used in infiltration attacks may include exploiting vulnerabilities in software,
            utilizing social engineering, or employing advanced persistent threats (APTs) to maintain
            long-term unauthorized access.

            <h2>Mitigation</h2>
            Organizations can defend against infiltration attacks by regularly updating
            software, implementing strong access controls, conducting security awareness training,
            and using intrusion detection and prevention systems.
