            <h2>About</h2>
            Dos-slowhttptest is a tool designed for testing the effectiveness of web server security
            against slow HTTP DoS attacks. This type of attack aims to exhaust server resources
            by opening multiple connections and sending incomplete HTTP requests, keeping the
            connections open for an extended period.

            <h2>Impact</h2>
            slowhttptest can lead to denial of service by consuming server resources,
            causing legitimate users to experience slow response times or rendering the server
            temporarily or permanently unavailable.

            <h2>Mitigation</h2>
            To defend against slowhttptest attacks, organizations can implement
            rate limiting, configure timeouts for idle connections, and deploy intrusion detection
            systems to detect and block malicious traffic patterns.
