            <h2>About</h2>
            A Denial of Service (DoS) Hulk attack, also known as HTTP Unbearable Load King,
            is a type of denial-of-service attack designed to overwhelm web servers by flooding
            them with a massive volume of HTTP requests. This can lead to server exhaustion
            and make the website temporarily or permanently unavailable.

            <h2>Impact</h2>
            The goal of the Hulk attack is to disrupt the normal functioning of a
            website or web application by overloading its server with a large number of requests.

            <h2>Mitigation</h2>
            To defend against DoS attacks like Hulk, organizations can implement
            traffic filtering, use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), and deploy intrusion prevention systems.
